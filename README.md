# C# Order System
This repository contains a Visual Studio 2017 project with classes to match the example studied during last week's class.

## How to download and open this code
Click the `Clone or Download` button towards the top right of the file listing above, then `Open in Visual Studio`.

## What does this code mean?
For a detailed explanation of this code, watch the lecture video within the module's Moodle space. This describes how and why the class files have been created in this structure, some of the unique features to implement associations such as generalisations and aggregations as well as suggestions for the Task 2 activity.

## How do I run the code?
Open the `Program.cs` file, and click `Start`. There is an example of using the order system in this file that you can modify to test the features.

## Is this code complete?
No. There are many features in this code that could be made more efficient, and it is missing many validation checks and features. The code in this repository was created to demonstrate the process of transferring a specific class diagram into C# code, and is definitely not complete.
